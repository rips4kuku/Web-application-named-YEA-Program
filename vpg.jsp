                                   YEA! Process is for an employee to print a copy of the Word form off the Web.  
                                   Fill in and hand it to the recipient, usually in front of the recipient’s manager.  
                                   The recipient fills out what certificate they would like and mails or hand carries the form to the YEA! Administrator.
                                   The Administrator then manually processes the award by making a copy of the submission 
                                   to mail to the recipient’s manager and mails back the award form with the award certificate to the recipient.

            A Web based submission form will be used to submit the data directly to a database, send an email to the recipient,and
            send an e mail to the recipient’s manager informing them of the award.  The recipient will return to the Web page to enter
            what certificate they want, as well as print off a copy of the award if they like.  Managers can run reports for  their 
            (or other) areas - recipients and submitters.  YEA! Administrator will print off a weekly report table of what awards are to be mailed out.
